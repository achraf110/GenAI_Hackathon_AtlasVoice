## Description
Our project will assist psychotherapist doctors in understanding their patients and reducing the time spent on each recorded audio file.

Problem:
Psychotherapists often spend a significant amount of time listening to and analyzing recorded audio dialogues with their patients, which can be a time-consuming process.
